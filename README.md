# I2C2

Ideate, Innovate, Code, Compete is an ideathon.
An ideathon is a short, intensive, workshop-like experience for students to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time. Participants work individually and use design thinking and innovative learning practices to ideate and collaborate on possible solutions.
